      description: The modeled architecture does not contain a build infrastructure (devops-client, sourcecode-repo, build-pipeline, etc.), which might be the risk of a model missing critical assets (and thus not seeing their risks). If the architecture contains custom-developed parts, the pipeline where code gets developed and built needs to be part of the model.
      impact: If this risk is unmitigated, attackers might be able to exploit risks unseen in this threat model due to critical build infrastructure components missing in the model.

      title: Missing Vault (Secret Storage)
      description: In order to avoid the risk of secret leakage via config files (when attacked through vulnerabilities being able to read files like Path-Traversal and others), it is best practice to use a separate hardened process with proper authentication, authorization, and audit logging to access config secrets (like credentials, private keys, client certificates, etc.). This component is usually some kind of Vault.
      impact: If this risk is unmitigated, attackers might be able to easier steal config secrets (like credentials, private keys, client certificates, etc.) once a vulnerability to access files is present and exploited.

      impact: If this risk is unmitigated, attackers successfully attacking other components of the system might have an easy path towards highly sensitive vault assets and their data stores, as they are not separated by network segmentation.
      asvs: V1 - Architecture, Design and Threat Modeling Requirements
      cheat_sheet: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.html
      action: Network Segmentation
      mitigation: Apply a network segmentation trust-boundary around the highly sensitive vault assets and their data stores.
      check: Are recommendations from the linked cheat sheet and referenced ASVS chapter applied?
      function: operations
      stride: elevation-of-privilege
      detection_logic: In-scope vault assets when surrounded by other (not vault-related) assets (without a network trust-boundary in-between). This risk is especially prevalent when other non-vault related assets are within the same execution environment (i.e. same database or same application server).
      risk_assessment: Default is medium impact. The impact is increased to high when the asset missing the trust-boundary protection is rated as strictly-confidential or mission-critical.
      false_positives: When all assets within the network segmentation trust-boundary are hardened and protected to the same extend as if all were vaults with data of highest sensitivity.

      cheat_sheet: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html
      action: XML Parser Hardening
      mitigation: Apply hardening of all XML parser instances in order to stay safe from XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities. When a third-party product is used instead of custom developed software, check if the product applies the proper mitigation and ensure a reasonable patch-level.
      check: Are recommendations from the linked cheat sheet and referenced ASVS chapter applied?
      function: development
      stride: information-disclosure
      detection_logic: In-scope technical assets accepting XML data formats.
      risk_assessment: The risk rating depends on the sensitivity of the technical asset itself and of the data assets processed. Also for cloud-based environments the exploitation impact is at least medium, as cloud backend services can be attacked via SSRF (and XXE vulnerabilities are often also SSRF vulnerabilities).
      false_positives: Fully trusted (i.e. cryptographically signed or similar) XML data can be considered as false positives after individual review.

      description: Sourcecode repositories (including their histories) as well as artifact registries can accidentally contain secrets like checked-in or packaged-in passwords, API tokens, certificates, crypto keys, etc.
      impact: If this risk is unmitigated, attackers which have access to affected sourcecode repositories or artifact registries might find secrets accidentally checked-in.
      asvs: V14 - Configuration Verification Requirements
      cheat_sheet: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.html
      action: Build Pipeline Hardening
      mitigation: Establish measures preventing accidental check-in or package-in of secrets into sourcecode repositories and artifact registries. This starts by using good .gitignore and .dockerignore files, but does not stop there. See for example tools like <i>"git-secrets" or "Talisman"</i> to have check-in preventive measures for secrets. Consider also to regularly scan your repositories for secrets accidentally checked-in using scanning tools like <i>"gitleaks" or "gitrob"</i>.

      impact: If this risk remains unmitigated, attackers might be able to trick logged-in victim users into unwanted actions within the web application by visiting an attacker controlled web site.
      asvs: V4 - Access Control Verification Requirements
      cheat_sheet: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html
      action: CSRF Prevention
      mitigation: Try to use anti-CSRF tokens ot the double-submit patterns (at least for logged-in requests). When your authentication scheme depends on cookies (like session or token cookies), consider marking them with the same-site flag. When a third-party product is used instead of custom developed software, check if the product applies the proper mitigation and ensure a reasonable patch-level.
      check: Are recommendations from the linked cheat sheet and referenced ASVS chapter applied?
      function: development
      detection_logic: In-scope web applications accessed via typical web access protocols.
      risk_assessment: The risk rating depends on the integrity rating of the data sent across the communication link.
      false_positives: Web applications passing the authentication sate via custom headers instead of cookies can eventually be false positives. Also when the web application is not accessed via a browser-like component (i.e not by a human user initiating the request that gets passed through all components until it reaches the web application) this can be considered a false positive.

      check: Are recommendations from the linked cheat sheet and referenced ASVS chapter applied?
      function: architecture
      stride: elevation-of-privilege
      detection_logic: In-scope technical assets (except load-balancer, reverse-proxy, service-registry, waf, ids, and ips and in-process calls) should authenticate incoming requests when the asset processes sensitive data. This is especially the case for all multi-tenant assets (there even non-sensitive ones).
      risk_assessment: The risk rating (medium or high) depends on the sensitivity of the data sent across the communication link. Monitoring callers are exempted from this risk.
      false_positives: Technical assets which do not process requests regarding functionality or data linked to end-users (customers) can be considered as false positives after individual review.

      stride: elevation-of-privilege
      detection_logic: In-scope identity provider assets and their identity data stores when surrounded by other (not identity-related) assets (without a network trust-boundary in-between). This risk is especially prevalent when other non-identity related assets are within the same execution environment (i.e. same database or same application server).
      risk_assessment: Default is high impact. The impact is increased to very-high when the asset missing the trust-boundary protection is rated as strictly-confidential or mission-critical.
      false_positives: When all assets within the network segmentation trust-boundary are hardened and protected to the same extend as if all were identity providers with data of highest sensitivity.

      title: Push instead of Pull Deployment
      description: When comparing push-based vs. pull-based deployments from a security perspective, pull-based deployments improve the overall security of the deployment targets. Every exposed interface of a production system to accept a deployment increases the attack surface of the production system, thus a pull-based approach exposes less attack surface relevant interfaces.
      impact: If this risk is unmitigated, attackers might have more potential target vectors for attacks, as the overall attack surface is unnecessarily increased.

      detection_logic: In-scope technical assets (excluding load-balancer) with confidentiality rating of confidential (or higher) or with integrity rating of critical (or higher) when accessed directly from the internet. All web-server, web-application, reverse-proxy, waf, and gateway assets are exempted from this risk when they do not consist of custom developed code and the data-flow only consists of HTTP or FTP protocols. Access from monitoring systems as well as VPN-protected connections are exempted.
      risk_assessment: The matching technical assets are at low risk. When either the confidentiality rating is strictly-confidential or the integrity rating is mission-critical, the risk-rating is considered medium. For assets with RAA values higher than 40 % the risk-rating increases.

Even though a WAF is not a replacement for security (all components must be secure even without a WAF) it adds another layer of defense to the overall system by delaying some attacks and having easier attack alerting through it.
      impact: If this risk is unmitigated, attackers might be able to apply standard attack pattern tests at great speed without any filtering.
